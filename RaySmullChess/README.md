** Ray and Smull's Chess Puzzle **

An introduction -- from Puzzles from Other Worlds
by Martin Gardner (Vintage Books - 1984):
Two young mathematicians in the computer shack of the spaceship Bagel, Ray and Smull, were enjoying a few hours of leisure by inventing unusual chess games to play with VOZ, the ship's computer.
"I've got a great idea," said Ray. "We'll ask VOZ to put the five black pieces - king, queen, bishop, knight, and rook - on five randomly selected squares of the board. We'll tell him not to display the pieces on the screen, but only to star the five cells where he puts them. You and I will sit at two consoles and wear earphones so each of us can ask VOZ questions, but neither of us can hear what he says to the other.
"And so?" said Smull.
"Each question," Ray went on, "will be about any designated square of the board. We'll ask VOZ how many pieces are attacking that cell."
"Can we ask about a starred cell?"
"Certainly. Of course no piece attacks the cell it is on. If we ask about a starred cell, the answer can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. If we ask about an empty cell, it can be [0,] 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Instead of asking how many pieces attack a cell, we can ask if a certain piece is on a certain cell. To such questions VOZ will answer yes or no."
"I think I can anticipate," said Smull. "VOZ will keep a record of the number of questions we ask until we have determined the positions of all five pieces. Whoever asked the fewest questions is the winner."
"You've got it!" said Ray. "It's a sort of chessboard version of the old twentieth-century game of Master Mind."

After playing the game for several weeks, Ray and Smull decided to make the game harder by telling VOZ not to indicate the positions of the five pieces. Otherwise, the game was played as before.

Mr. Gardner acknowledges his indebtedness to Jaime Poniachik of Buenos Aires for suggesting this game.
